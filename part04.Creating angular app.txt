	PART4: CREATING THE FIRST ANGULAR APP
         --------------/-------------------
- AngulariS is based on the model view controller, whereas Angular
2 is based on the components structure. Angular 4 works on the
same structure as Angular2 but is faster when compared to
Angular2.

- Angular4 uses TypeScript 2.2 version whereas Angular 2 uses
Typescript version 1.8. This brings a lot of difference in the
performance.

- To install Angular 4, the Angular team came up with Angular CLI
which eases the installation. You need to run through a few
commands to install Angular 4.
